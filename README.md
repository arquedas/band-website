HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were technologies used in the development of the project.




Deployment and Testing:

Work began on styling a background for the entire site.

The nav bar was then developed.  Code from the bootstrap lesson on the Whiskey website was incorporated with modifications to the styling (colour, sizing, images).

On the home page a carousel was included using code from Bootstrap, again with modifications to size and position.

The audio, video and band pages were then developed.
    A grid was implemented spanning 3 columns and 3 rows.  Videos, audio clips and photo images were placed here.
    The pages were tested for responsiveness using chrome dev tools.  The project was developed with a mobile first approach.
    
The bookings page was developed with snippets of code from the resume project from the course.
Sizing, colour and layout were altered as well as additions to the form.

The footer was developed lastly using Bootstrap.
The social links were developed using font awesome with additional help from W3C for styling.

Overall the website includes the functionality given in the brief as stated above.
It was developed using the necessary technologies and coding.
The website is also responsive given the mobile first approach used in development.
The band is showcased and the needs are met.
